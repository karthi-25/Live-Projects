0,Handa,7 September 2018,1.0 out of 5 stars,Damaged product,Received damaged productAll scratched
1,Aishwarya V,26 August 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars,My mother loves it!,"Gifted this to my mother. She was reluctant to use it first as she is used to the usual frying process. But as she got used to it, she loved it! She still thanks me for this (even after 2 years) because this has made her life so much easier. Some yummy snacks can be made in this air fryer with minimal effort. It's especially great if guests are coming over and you quickly want to prepare snacks. Amazing product! And Philips is better than other brands in this category."
2,Anubha Jha,11 January 2019,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broken - Be aware,My product was broken when it arrived. Unfortunately I was out of town (proof of travel available) when the product was delivered and could only check a month later to be shocked and feel so much of my hard earned money was wasted. Its kept untouched and unused. Please help if you can
3,Kshitij Gupta,9 July 2020,4.0 out of 5 stars,No recipe book!!,"It is definitely easy to use n totally mess free but it Is definitely not easy to clean. My biggest complaint is that there is no recipe book with the airfryer. Didn't expect this from a company like Phillips who is a pioneer in this field .After buying a product worth 10 k ,they expect us to search for recipes online!!!"
4,Amazon Customer,27 October 2018,1.0 out of 5 stars,very upset need a refund,Finally unboxed the item and tried to cook fries and found out that the the product was damaged . Really disappointed that I received a defective product after paying so much money. Not worth it at all
5,Abhijit Jaiswal,15 October 2019,1.0 out of 5 stars,Product doesn't work,"We bought this a couple of days back and tried to prepare French fries multiple times, but not even once were the potatoes fully prepared. We prepared it for 45-50 minutes on 180 and 200 degree, but it never worked. It just made the potatoes a little warm and that's all. Philips is not more a trusted brand, the light switches on for just a minute and turns off. The technician even couldn't cook potato fries(very small pieces) himself even after 20-25 minutes. Also the technian/customer support in Bangalore is bossy, even though their visiting hours are from 9-6, the technician says he works only between 12-4 and is not ready to come after 4. Philips isn't doing things correctly."
6,Siddhartha Sengupta,28 December 2019,1.0 out of 5 stars,Used product delivered,"Not at all a pleasant experience as it seems I have received an Used product. There area) Scratches all over the bodyb) Tray when opened couldn’t be closed completely due to a loose part in the Tray compartment which was obstructing Tray closure.c) Box should have User Manual, Recipe Book (as shown in unboxing videos). There are no such things present inside the box.Have ordered for a replacement."
7,COLONEL,18 August 2017,5.0 out of 5 stars,Should have been supplied with a Separator as shown in ...,"Should have been supplied with a Separator as shown in the VIDEO.And also an additional Roasting  Rack, which was advertised separately,Cost at Rs 900/- considered too high.At additional discounted cost, however."
8,abilash shrestha,17 March 2019,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice fryer . Easy to clean.,It is nice airfryer come with heavy socket electric cord .Arrived in safe package in big box without any damaged . Come with indian receipe book. I tried fish with it and it is tasty. Just follow the book for use. Easy to clean .
9,tthato,7 December 2018,1.0 out of 5 stars,Waste product,Air frier technology is not at all good for frying. It use heat & high speed air  which make the food very dry.For healthy cooking (oil less) micro oven is best.
10,AK,12 August 2019,4.0 out of 5 stars,Must buy.,"Received it 2 days back. On time delivery. Cheers amazon. Tried it today with a variety of frozen foods..Excellent product. The only reason I deduct 1* is, for if it says 20min of fry time, do 15min. If u follow the book recipes u will have dry hard food. Bad recipes or chefs who guided them on timing. Discover ur own textures. Overall hardware is good."
11,tejesh,23 October 2020,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent, using it from last 4 years","Using it from last 4 years. Bot new one for relatives.Pros:easy to useGives really good flavour as compared to other air fryers.Minimize oil consumptionDiscards excessive oilCons:Costly as compared to competitorsExperience: its really good product and we use it atleast once a week,You can cook tasty chicken, mutton, fish veggitables, kababs, cookies and most of the things that needs rosti g or frying (except Bhaji which has too much liquid)"
12,BM,10 May 2017,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very very good output,"Cleaning is not quite easy, quantity it can handle is good for small family of 2/3. Operation is extremely easy."
13,Sangeet P Pillai,16 October 2019,3.0 out of 5 stars,Ideal for bachelor not for family,"I returned this product since it had small capacity, not ideal for family of 4. It is good if you are a bachelor and eat 3-4 only pieces of grilled chicken. Else for a family you would have to do many rounds of grilling which defeats the purpose of saving time with this gadget. There are other bigger ovens in the other brands with lower or same cost which is ideal to cook for a family and provided with many accessories. Philips air frier is good only for one dish mainly, French fries, but then that's it."
14,RJ,11 December 2020,1.0 out of 5 stars,Used product delivered,A used product was delivered. We had gifted this and the pack was opened only today. Oil stains were seen and oil smell also felt.  Now it is beyond returnable period. Feel cheated
15,Karl,25 December 2020,4.0 out of 5 stars,Philips Daily Collection HD9218 Air Fryer,"Arrived on time and was well packed. This is the second Philips Air Fryer I am ordering so obviously I am happy with the product. Sad to see that the ""ON"" Indicator light has been quietly deleted from this model. Who knows why! It was a useful feature to have and a backward step on the part of Philips to remove it. Have docked them 1 star for this."
16,Amazon Customer,23 November 2020,5.0 out of 5 stars,Super device,"We decided to buy it to avoid oily food and it worth it! Even French fries is perfect in that, we tried already few things and it’s really good in taste, easy to use and fast as well. It’s better that oven actually."
17,Amazon Customer,20 June 2020,1.0 out of 5 stars,Damaged product recieved and not accepting return any soon,It's really disappointing that the product I recieved was malfunctioning  and its motor isn't functioningWhen tried to place a return of itemNobody is picking up the call from help centerNeither Amazon is responding to my return requestIf they can't give this much customer support I'll be forced to withdraw any purchase from Amazon in future..
18,Dr Samir Kumar Mujray,27 November 2017,1.0 out of 5 stars,Received broken product,"Received broken product, had to return it."
19,RENJITH NAIR,4 January 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Product,"Excellent product, no oil required I luv it this is my second air fryer for my cousin as a gift. You need to buy a metal brush to clean the metal mesh, better to soke the frying pan for easy cleaning."
20,Umer shah,19 February 2021,4.0 out of 5 stars,Health and smile can go hand in hand,"I have used the air fryer for a week now and below is my experience.I have been trying a lot around cooking, i have tried everything from frying.. oven.. cooker,  name it and i would have tested it.Air fryer is the first goto option when you want an easy to use appliance and get best taste out.Phillips has killed it with this model. Its an absolute delight to have such fryer around. You can twist recipes based on your needs. It is easiest appliance i have used for cooking. Fun and Health.. what else you want the fryer to do. Put the delicious food into your mouth. Lol"
21,Saurabh Maurya,8 October 2019,5.0 out of 5 stars,Makes cooking super easy,"Bacon, prawns, burger patties are both tastier and easier to make in this. We've had fun making a whole host of items in this - fries, chicken legs, grilled paneer, grilled veggies etc.A lot of times, I buy pre-marinated meat from Licious and just pop it into the air fryer. Easiest cooking ever :)Anything you'd grill/fry come out really well and cook in 5-15 minutes. Perfect for lazy people."
22,Kindle Customer,24 February 2021,2.0 out of 5 stars,NOT HAPPY,"Received the product, there was no instruction manual accompanying the fryer. A skimpy printout, in a million languages, extremely brief and uninformative. I am extremely disappointed, at least a basic recipe book is a must. I had expected a better accompaniment from a reputed company, like Philips. There is no way the cord retracts, as mentioned. Am sorry that the product is non-returnable, else I would have opted for it at once. An expensive trinket for the kitchen DISAPPOINTED, TOTALLY. Am stuck with it. A total NO-NO."
23,Rajiv Menon,17 December 2020,1.0 out of 5 stars,Get the correct instructions for proper  useage of the product.,"I am afraid I cannot give an opinion on the product as it has not been used so far. There are no clear instructions nor a brochure illustrating the proper useage of the product. I do not want to damage the product without proper instructions. This is an expensive product !I would be grateful if I can get proper instructionson for its useage. I am sure it is a very good product, but I have to  first use it. Hope I can get positive response from concerned department on my query.Thank you,Rajiv Menon"
24,Saswata,28 November 2020,2.0 out of 5 stars,No after sales service in my location,"There was no product demo online, nor did any person visit to demo the usage.It was a bad after sales service experience in my location.I tried contacting philips customer care fpr hours, but never got connected to any of their operatives.I am clueless how to use it and the fear of burning away the air frier keeps me from using the product."
25,Varun A.,2 December 2020,3.0 out of 5 stars,Think before you buy. Check other brands as well,"Demo provided by company after 8days and when used for first time, it stopped working within 15min. Logged complaint with Philips n they said can repair but denied aa new product. Logged complaint on national consumer forum n Philips replaced product in 10days.Bought on 27oct and got replacement on 28nov"
26,Amey,27 October 2020,2.0 out of 5 stars,Looks good but no user manual or cooking guide,Package and delivery was up to mark. Thanks Amazon. There is no user manual ot cooking instructions help documents included with it. If you buy from Chroma you get the same. Manual attachment on discription page is corrupted and unable to access it.Now will have to check on you tube..will provide more feedback once I use it.
27,Rk,19 December 2020,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the money...too much hype of electric fryer,"Its not so sophisticated...not sure why they charge so much in the name of a electric fryer. Once started there’s no button to stop or pause, even when you take out the tray the fry still runs....I hope someone would have already figured out to make an electric fryer with a small fan on top of a heating coil"
28,Kapil,15 August 2018,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Clearing old stock, without disclosure","Product is good.But, Amazon should disclose date of manufacture in advertisement.It was more than two years old manufacture."
29,Ashish Anand,19 January 2021,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Product has scratch on the teflon coating, no booklet","Really disappointed by the Air Fryer. There was no instruction guide,  recipe booklet, warranty card, etc. Looks like a used product. Once we open the pull out container found a scratch inside over the teflon coating . Didn't expect this from a brand like Philips. Bad experience."
30,Ambika,9 December 2020,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst experience with Amazon. Philips had loat one customer today,Worst product received from Amazon had received airfryer in broken condition. The courier person was bad in speaking he dint helped me replacing my item thought he bought a new replaced Airfryer he took it back saying that you might have demanded it.
31,nm,18 July 2019,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good product,"Versatile product, easy to use. Innovation in recipes can be tried for optimum utilization. I've tried baking, making curries, frying onions for masala of curries after buying the accessories...very little oil needed so overall healthier cooking without compromising on taste"
32,Neelima,28 October 2018,2.0 out of 5 stars,Something gave way on first use!,"It seemed very nice & strurdy. But after 1st use, a metal strip, don't know what it is supposed to do, came down and blocked the food tray from going in again. Likely to return."
33,Samrat,16 November 2020,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product from Philips,"Compared to other Air Fryer, Philips product is robust and lasts long. Have used it since the day we received it. Great product. No issue at all.  Good value for money. We were a bit apprehensive about the product after reading reviews by other users. But found the product to be a great one. Must have if you want to have tasty and healthy food."
34,Aman ,22 November 2017,5.0 out of 5 stars,Philips Airfry is a wonderful User Friendly Product,"Philips Airfry is a wonderful User Friendly Product,  very useful for people who are Calorie Conscious.... Thank u Amazon for Prompt Delivery with Good Packing"

36,Amazon Customer,22 September 2019,1.0 out of 5 stars,Loose spring,"Received the product with a spring loose, so it wasn't easy to insert/remove the tray. The replacement also has the same defect. GLittle disappointed that I received a defective product twice, but Amazon return/refund was hazzle free.The packaging was good. So, I guess this is a manufacturing/factory defect."
37,Joyous Tiger,31 January 2019,2.0 out of 5 stars,Durability - electrical wiring,Whilst the overall product is designed and works well. The quality that you expect from Philips in the wiring that connects the appliance to the electric socket is not done well. The coil holding has come lose in less than one month of use and one wire is sticking out.
38,Lynette,5 September 2020,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good Product,"The product is a must in every household, happy with the purchase. It's only drawback is the cleaning process; as the food tends to stick to the grill and it becomes difficult to clean."
39,Smita,5 September 2020,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good product,"Roast food evenly. Frozen snacks come out so well that you can't tell the difference between fried ones or Air-Fried ones.if you are a foodie and still want to avoid oil, then definitely go for it.  Only one thing is , it is very difficult to clean."
40,Monika,14 November 2018,1.0 out of 5 stars,Received broken!!!,"Very disappointed with the item, received my air fryer today with crack on the handle and front left side of the air fryer is broken with the  size of table tennis ball hole. I am scared to reorder this time again"
41,Mayank S.,21 March 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,Brilliant,"Reduces 90% fat and 75% guilt.Convenient and useful.The hearing time and preparation time seems a little too much, with 15-20 minutes preheat time and an equal food preparation time, but it’s worth it. Everything is so crisp and well made."
42,Subodh Sood,29 October 2020,1.0 out of 5 stars,Faulty Product Delivered,"The product should be checked before dispatch by seller weather it is in working condition as quality check. Why the faulty product delivered by such big brand. Further Amazon has removed the option of return. Customer faith has been shaken after buying branded without option of return the product , if it is faulty."
43,UdayaBhasker G.,18 June 2020,5.0 out of 5 stars,Superb airfryer for all your snack needs.,Wonderful cute device for healthy snacks. Enjoying daily/ weekly using it . Can’t write more. Have no words. Can’t forget its “ting” calling bell once the snack is ready..😄 Highly recommended.
44,Sukanya Samanta,19 December 2020,5.0 out of 5 stars,Must buy..,These are some of the pics of all cooking done. We just love the airfyer..I couldnt find the pic of Samsosa and Gujiya..but everything is prepared very well. I am reviewing it after 1year of regular use. It's a must buy.
45,Vish,30 November 2019,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you are conscious to bring down the oil in take in your food, this is a good product.","For those who are becoming conscious of daily consumption of oil through our staple food, this is a great product to add to your kitchen.  Apart from the recipe suggested by Phillips' cook-book, you have a lot of opportunity to be creative as to how you want to use it."
46,CHANNA C REDDY,22 November 2020,1.0 out of 5 stars,Malfunctioning Fryer,"I have used air fryers before and never had this problem. The basket is not going into the air fryer. I have not even used it once properly. How am I supposed to cook anything if the basket is not locked into the fryer?Why is amazon sending so many defective products like this. Don't you guys do quality checks.Waste of 10,000. If I can give zero stars I would."
47,Harpreet,31 October 2020,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not Expected !!!,"Used item...!!Body full of scratches...inner tray rusted, full of oil stains and stinking of fried chicken.Even droplets of water found in the tray, clearly indicating someone has used...washed...and repacked the item."

49,Jaganath Pradhan,13 October 2020,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome product!!!,"A very versatile product. From making tikkas to fried items to baking cakes, everything comes out perfect.The only con is sometimes the food items stick to the grill mesh and it can be a little difficult to clean. Though some racks are available using which can make our work easier but we have to buy it extra not provided with this product."

63,Kailash,6 December 2014,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fast and a very effective way of cooking.,"Fantastic piece of technology. It is reliable. Cooking in this air fryer is an experience. It is easy and cooks perfect. The taste of food cooked in this air fryer is subjective as we are so used to eating oil fried food. It takes a while to adjust our taste buds. But, gives you the guilt free feeling. I recommend this product to each and everyone. It is a worth product in your kitchen."
64,Megha,29 October 2020,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good product at reasonable price,The product is working as per expectations but the point is that this product is not made in India.

I has no radiation just simple mechanism that it has coil which heats up and a high speed fan which flows air through the coil i.e. air gets hot due to coil and that hot air fries the food simple .And best part is no need of oil!

With proper use and maintenance it's still as good as new. Please note as this is small size, large amount if good will have to be cooked in batches. If you are cooking large amount often go for a larger sized airfryer."

638,MJK,7 November 2014,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very useful for the health conscious,"First of all, great deal and timely delivery thanks to Amazon. This is very useful product for the health conscious. The results are very good when eatables are fired with very less oil. The point to note here is that the food items are well cooked in the air fryer but they will definitely taste slightly different since we are used to those soaked in oil. But the crispiness and moisture is retained as in deep frying....unlike when cooked in a microwave. The frying process takes slightly longer time than usual deep frying so you have to cater for more time especially when entertaining guests. The air fryer is most useful for dry or semi-dry items like samosa , kachori only. It cannot be used to fry items dipped in besan or viscous items. All in all, it is a very useful item and can drastically reduce our oil consumption."
639,Sameer Khan,28 April 2017,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best in class,Thats why I love Philips. They made super awesome products. It's completely make your oily food oil-free and tasty. Go for it. I bought it a year ago and not a single issue and use it every alternate days.
640,NS,15 June 2014,5.0 out of 5 stars,For the healthy plate of fried snacks!!!!!!,This is the perfect appliance for the foodies!!! When u think of fried snacks u think of calories and all that oil intake and toiling at the gas stove. Since I got this appliance enjoying the fried snacks is easier. The perfect even golden color crisp snacks with no oil makes for a healthy snack!
641,Saurabh Agarwal,18 November 2014,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Air Fryer,"This is great product. As described by the company it uses a awesome technology of air and heat. You can make rotis, parathas , samosa, fringer chips and many more items wit minimum use of oil. If you use 1 spoon full of oil to make parathas then in this you just need to use 2 drops of oil and rest this cooker would take care. So if you want to enjoy junky food and still want remain healthy and go ahead buy this product. But remember do not buy it from snapdeal.com I repeat do not buy it from snapdeal.com. Best place to buy today is amazon.in. You can check other websites but don't ever buy it form snapdeal.com."
642,Etrigan the Demon,31 August 2014,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing product from philips and superb service from Amazon,"Seller service was good. So was Amazon's.This is my first Amazon purchase. I was surprised when the product arrived just two days after purchase! I bought a hard drive some days after buying this. It was also delivered within 2 days!Way to go Amazon! You should beat Snapdeal and even Flipkart with ease.Coming to the product, now that I have used it thrice, I can vouch it does what the company claims it does. My mom made potato fries, ""parothas"" and 'bora's(a bengali cutlet) with absolutely 0% oil. I am sensitive to oily food, so I bought this. For over a decade I have been avoiding fried delicacies. Now after all these years I am finally able to taste fried food, thanks to Philips Airfryer.If you are a health freak like me but still want to eat fried stuff, then go for it.You will not regret it.I"
643,Vaibhav Akankar,1 November 2015,5.0 out of 5 stars,Mind Blowing...Just superbbbbb....,"I am very satisfied with this product. Just received 2 days back and tried fries and roasted veggies (Capsicum, okra, brinjal, pumpkin, onion, bitter gourd, cauliflower, green peas all together ) and I was really surprised with the result. I just used 1 tsp olive oil and mixed herbs (oregano, basil, thyme, chilly flakes etc) and the taste was really good. First time I could eat around 300 gm veggies without any guilt. I love vegetables but I was avoiding because of too much of oil in cooking. I tried lot of time in nonstick pan with very less oil but the taste was horrible so I gave up that method also but after trying with this air fry I just loved it in first attempt. This is really a great product and I thank Philips and Amazon both for making my life much more healthier. If your story match with myself then I would strongly recommend you to try it out. I should have bought this long back -:)"
644,V_111,25 June 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars,Really happy with it,"Love the Philips airfryer. Pondered lots before buying it. Finally bought it during promotion and even availed attractive cash back. Works really well. So far have tried frozen snacks, haryali kebabs, bread rolls, French fries with it and they have turned out fine. Samosas cook the best. Technique needs to be figured out with practice. Texture will be slightly different but we really don’t mind as it’s a healthier option. Very, very easy to use and clean. Wish it was slightly bigger though."
645,Sajid S,30 December 2014,5.0 out of 5 stars,wish there was an option given to remove the grill from the tray so it could be very easy to clean it,"A superb Product, utilises minimum oil to cook food. Takes a while to cook but it is worth the wait, when you get to eat literally oil free food and at the same time tasty.Also its a little delicate and difficult to clean, wish there was an option given to remove the grill from the tray so it could be very easy to clean it. Overall a must recommended product for the kind of  results it can deliver."
646,Shalini,18 December 2013,4.0 out of 5 stars,fabulous product!,"I am loving the air fryer, have made potato wedges, medu vadas and am in the process of trying out fries. The reason I gave it 4 stars, is because of the size, I know that else where there is a bigger capacity air fryer available, and I think that would be perfect!!"
647,VAR,2 November 2014,2.0 out of 5 stars,Its like drying under the sun,I bought Airfrier after reading the reviews. The concept of air frying is not suitable for Indian cooking and taste. The food is dry after cooking. Its like drying under the sun. The quantity of certain food variety that can be cooked is less in a batch. More trays in vertical direction like a stack should have been provided. The food sticks to the mesh and difficult to clean. Its good for finger chips. Might be good to cook meat -not tired. Dont expect more.
648,Raj Mendon,21 February 2015,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for quick snacks viz,"Great for quick snacks viz., fries, off the shelf potato bites, tikkis, burgers.  Paneer shahslik is a household hit as is mini pizzas. Overall a great buy!  Wish we had food seperators and additional cooking tray so that we could cook double qty at one time.  These items are available abroad so I guess soon it will be made here...  We cook only veg food in this fryer, but there will be a whole lot of possibilities for non-veg lovers."
649,Amit khanna,2 January 2015,4.0 out of 5 stars,has added tremendous amount of convenience in my kitchen as you can pretty much put the stuff in it,"have been using this for the last few months, has added tremendous amount of convenience in my kitchen as you can pretty much put the stuff in it, shut it and forget it. The app available for the product has a number of recipes. There is also a fairly active facebook community that is useful for recipes as well as tips and tricks. The build quality could have been slightly more robust which is why this scores 4 and not 5 stars."
650,Karunamaya Kajekar,7 May 2014,5.0 out of 5 stars,Healthy way to eat!,"This air fryer surely won our hearts from Day 1. It not only saves on unwanted oil that we Indians add to fry food stuffs but retains the ingredient's taste without adding the unnatural taste of the heated /overheated oil.Mot suitable for light frying sausages, frankfurters etc, as they shrink or the skin cracks. Other than that we have tried non veg and veg foods - comes out better than deep frying."
651,RG,19 March 2015,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good product but would never be part of your day to day cooking.,"Good... I use it mainly to reheat parathas, which come out crisp and fresh. Other than that its a fancy item, which you would use for first week and then keep it back in one corner of kitchen to be occasionally used.  If you are buying it for fries, they come out are horrible. Some things like mushrooms and baby corn come out great."
652,senthil murugan,4 November 2015,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome product , Crispy food items without oil or with less oil","Just tried to chicken nuggets and french fries, awesome.with just 10 ml of oil , i have fried 500 mg french fries and just another 10 ml of oil to fry chicken nuggets.The feedback is usage after 3 days, still planned a lot for yummy food items.NOTE:As it is amazon full filled items. it didnt have any packing by amazon which used to be."
653,Nikku,6 June 2016,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thanks AMAZON :),"5 Stars for amazon,Recived philips air fryer and it had some issues, reported to amazon and they just changed it, fantastic customer serviceNow about the air fryer, philips has scored high, very neat and fantastic product,Cooked fryes ,chicken, fish and paneer, all food taste great and almost all food cooked in very less oilThere is a very strong need for other attachments like backing try and others also need basting brushUnbelievably satisfied😌"
654,Sandeep Bidasaria,29 January 2014,3.0 out of 5 stars,good product,"it is a good product which allows you to enjoy food which is normally fried but without the extra calories. However, it takes a longer time to 'airfry'. Also not all cuisines can be air fried. Very good for french fries though."
655,Seshu kumar,13 November 2014,3.0 out of 5 stars,Phillips viva air fryer is a useful item considering the consciousness of excess cholesterol today,"Phillips viva air fryer is a useful item considering the consciousness of excess cholesterol  today. It would help if either Phillips or Amazon organise ""at home"" demos on how various indian dishes can be made using this fryer since we are able to use for only a few vegetables and dishes"
656,Ashish Banerjee,6 February 2015,5.0 out of 5 stars,"original taste, easy cooking and healthy stuff","This is a very good product. Since I got this we tried French fries, chicken nuggets, chicken wings, Basa fish and all are excellent in taste. Home made or frozen both are great. All these done almost without oil. I bought a brush which my wife used. Great stuff."
657,Reena Ganguly,29 January 2015,5.0 out of 5 stars,I received the philips air fryer in perfect condition. I have used the product to make ...,"Thanks , Amazon ! ! I received the philips air fryer in perfect condition . I have used the product to make finger chips , tandoori pomfret , chicken steak & fried vegetables  , till today  . I am very happy with the product & am sure I can use it to make many more lip- smacking delicacies ."
658,Samrat Ahuja,26 August 2014,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice innovation and a big thumbs up,"First of all, kudos to Amazon for a fine delivery. Very well packed and protected to avoid any external damage. Now the product, using it for almost 3 weeks now and I am satisfied. Oil is used far less than it was being consumed earlier, but my only issue so far is that chicken seems to be remaining under cooked even after being cooked for 20 mins at 180-200 degree Celsius. Amazing fries though, tried many things already like chicken tikka, chicken 65, all working fell.Over all, a big thumbs up"
659,mohit mittal,7 March 2015,4.0 out of 5 stars,good for non veg,Hi I purchased this fryer from Amazon around week ago and I am very happy with it its basically useful for nonveg dishes like chicken .veg item tends to feel very dry it can't take place of conventional oil frying it's more like a roasting a dish rather than frying I made chicken legs chicken tikka and mcain fries it all turned out very well but veg kababs were very dry its difficult to eat them buy it only if u are non veg lover or else buy a otg it will save u lot of money
