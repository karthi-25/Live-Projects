0,Unknown ,11 August 2019,5.0 out of 5 stars,Dream come true product,It's a dream come true product. I bought it as deal of the day and functions are amazing. Easy to use. I have even used their semi auto washing machine. Thanx amazon for selling it
1,Viraj Patel,3 January 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,Superb OTG with Premium Quality,"Superb looks, functions really well. I am an experienced baker, I tend to use my OTGs heavily, almost daily! This one is performing as expected. Little bit pricy but worth it, Gives posh look in your kitchen.Widebody, let's me cook delicious Cast iron pizzas in it. I can bake a lot of stuff at a time. Must buy!"
2,Amazon Customer,21 July 2019,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Product,Product meets our expectation. It's easy to use and performance is excellent
3,Devanu,7 February 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really happy with the purchase,"We were apprehensive about buying an air fryer, having spent the last three decades frying fish in a kadhai with abundant cooking oil. However, purchasing an air fryer has been quite an epiphany. It's really easy to use and the fried fish came out really well and flavorful. The end product was in some ways even better than the output with cooking gas. We are really happy with this purchase."
4,Mihir Patil,20 August 2020,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good product at a great price,"My friend has this Inalsa air fryer since over a year and considering he was very happy with the purchase, I bought this air fryer too at a price of 4377 (plus additional 10% sbi discount). It got delivered in a day. To my utter disappointment, the air fryer stopped working on the first day itself. It was simply dead. I ordered replacement and the replacement air fryer came in another 24 hours. I was kinda sceptical at this point and tried the air fryer, immediately after it arrived. To my surprise, it had few minor scratches here and there but I paid least attention towards them and tried using the air fryer. It worked! I am writing this review after around 2-3 months of usage and can say that it is working quite nicely. Have made many dishes and the experience has been good. It's not very good when it comes to deep fried items like Pakora or Samosas but it definitely is a good replacement for normal shallow frying and grilling. Overall, I am quite satisfied with the purchase."
5,Shashikant Yeole,18 August 2020,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than expected,"Excellent way for cooking for veg and Non-veg families. What a perfect nonveg chicken tikka prepared, better than eating outside in hotel, fish fry perfect. Also tried french fries, veg cheese balls, all cooked so well. Remains hot from inside for much longer time than we do fry on pan or even in tandoor. So happy to buy and eat food cooked in this air fryer.Cons: The lock for frying pan gets stuck, manufacturer Inalsa must think of this point to avoid annoyance of the user.Also they should try to use electronic timer instead of mechanical one for these product if not done already."
6,Amazon Customer,28 July 2019,1.0 out of 5 stars,Poor design and Quality. Look for something Better.,"An impulse purchase based on Inalsa Brand name but I am disappointed. Product got delivered on evening of 27July 2019 yesterday and opened this morning 28th. Tried cooking french fries and the product worked flawlessly for the first 10 mins. As after 10 mins, I had to shake the fries, it stopped working and took lots of adjustment which was a mood spoiler. The next lot i.e. third time it stopped working at all and it's all due to poor mechanism.To summarise:- Product is easy to use and clean provided it's in use.-If it works well, don't expect it to be a lasting product as build quality is filmsy.- The unlock mechanism of fryer is faulty and can lead to unlocking of fryer from base and base will fall down too while removing contents.Based on the above retuning my product and will look for something better."
7,Rajesh Kumar Dhunna,30 January 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,Digital ease and 4l size,Excellent all rounder.. Worth every penny.. This 4l model with digital ease is far superior to philips model.. which is expensive as well.. Good size for the family of 4 and few guests.. Go for it..
8,MANISHA J.,14 April 2019,4.0 out of 5 stars,Value for money,"Nice thing. We are fond of eating French fries, potato cutlets, samosas and other stuff, it saves a great deal on oil.Best product for the price.Though it they could have arranged for a demo, it would have been the best.Demo person didn't come even after multiple mails and calls. He fixed a date too and even then didn't show up."
9,Nabeel Sultan,7 July 2019,1.0 out of 5 stars,Loose body. Top cover not closing tightly,Paint of the baking tray coming off.  If its paint then too much bad for health.Then rust developing and that too is ferric red color type rust.Don't know what happened when I used itfor the second time since delivery of the product.  But may be while delivery or manufacturing defect. Top cover not closing completely and due to this the power is turning off. Has to put heavy object over it to let it continue operation. Waiting for Amazon's approval for return or repair.Need to operate for too long to cook completely. The timer is only 30 minutes but one cycle of 30 minutes is enough only for streaming the food. For frying the food it takes more than 1 cycle of 30 minutes
10,Vigneshkumar j,22 July 2020,5.0 out of 5 stars,Product quality is good,"Product quality and packing is good. It's 10BK kind a small one so while booking please check the size carefully because this can cook for 2/3 person. Worth buying for small family. Working function is too simple. They includes wire rack, DIP tray, glove and manual. In that manual some cooking tips are provided."
11,UMRA WASEEM,9 October 2019,1.0 out of 5 stars,GOOD Product But Bad Services,"It was a faulty product. I complaint to their customer care no. And they told me that their technician will pay a visit in 48-72 hrs and see to it But to our disappointment noboby ever came ! I also complained here bt that to was of no use ! Atlast we have to take it to the service center in our city all by ourself and where they very irresponsibly and casually told us ki ""Han complain to aai thi"" and they didn't care in the first place so we had to leave the product there and got the fault fixed after some days ! Now it works fine and is easy to use.. Bt their negligence is just not something that is acceptable!"
12,Nehal Kidwai,13 September 2020,3.0 out of 5 stars,Don't Buy-nsensitive Customer Care..Hopeless Service Centre.Irresponsive Customer Care,After a couple of months of use--the on/off Switch has stopped workingThe Customer Care is not respondingThey finally responded and asked e at home between 1230 to 5 pm else bring the Productas the Service Centre works only between this petiod Monday to Sat
13,Sanjay Yadav,23 January 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product,"Its too early to write a review as i got this product 2 days back. I purchased this for baking purpose and I love its  convection mode. It bakes the cake evenly from all directions. The quality of material is good, the accessories like grill tray and baking pan are also of good quality. The door has double glass which prevents the outer door from heating. Overall its a super product this price level."
14,Ratneesh N.,7 August 2020,4.0 out of 5 stars,Bake pan missing as mentioned in the ad,"The equipment deserves five stars. I have deducted one star because the mentioned bake pan was missing when I opened the box. What's the use of oven without bake pan. Moreover, why would I spend extra 1000 rupees on the utensil which I should be getting for free along with the oven. Else, the oven's body was firm and stylish. One can go for it, if all the accessories are available, especially the baking pan."
15,Meher Krishna Raju B,16 June 2020,2.0 out of 5 stars,MADE IN CHINA,"I brought this after comparing other fryers displayed on Amazon. The reason I chose Inslsa, even though it was a bit costly than other models, is because it is shown as made in India among the queries section. This is MADE IN CHINA. I wish they are Frank enough to admit it, so that we can make a righteous choice."
16,Himanshu,31 October 2019,1.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't work anymore Amazon is sell so cheap quality products,Its broken in 1-2 months very light use. The food pan in out automatic ON OFF switch is broken. Doesn't work anymore Amazon is sell so cheap quality products
17,Raj Yadav,15 January 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice product,"It has all the function which a decent OTG should have. Moreover, it adds beauty to your kitchen. I recommend to go for it without any hesitation, buying it won't disappoint you."
18,sharda devi,16 November 2020,4.0 out of 5 stars,Working fine!! Must go for bigger version,"It is a perfect OTG for beginners not much function just a simple timer button and it have bell that rings loudly I like that, temperature upto 300 degree is fine in 10 ltr version.What I want to suggest that go for a 20 ltr or 16 ltr version because even if you are two member family anything less than 16 ltr will not serve the purpose I did a mistake and somehow I kept this.Overall it's a good OTG for beginners"
19,TK,17 October 2020,4.0 out of 5 stars,(Almost) the perfect airfryer,"I'm reviewing this 3 months after my purchase. I use this every weekend. 90% of usage is to make frozen items like chicken popcorn, nuggets, shami kebabs, and frozen samosas.. The device does a great job of cooking these.. The timer and temperature dials are easy to use.  The only problem I've had with the device is that the pan has started to erode in 2 months of light use.. I use a soft sponge to clean it, so that the coating doesn't come off, but in certain parts of the pan rhe coating has come off, which means sometimes food sticks while being cooked"
20,Amazon Customer,13 April 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Very Good Air Fryer,Wanted to buy a good and Affordable Air Fryer for a long time.

24,Sanjukta Mishra,11 August 2020,2.0 out of 5 stars,So my suggestion for others to speak to the seller thoroughly before buying,I had complain about the seller. After I purchased the product the seller lowered the price. I felt cheated.The product is not Indian made as replied by some seller . It is Chinese made . So I am very disappointed. Working wise it is very slow. So overall I am not satisfied.
25,Ria Bhadani,27 November 2019,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst service. Poor quality product.,"The product had a manufacturing defect due to which there was no heating.

26,A,7 July 2019,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst experience,Received a defective product... The customer service of inalsa is very poor.... Registered a complaint at inalsa customer service... There was no response.... I have returned the product...
27,pragya bhargava,21 September 2020,4.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for a small family of 2-3 people as the size is small,I got this OTG after going through soo many other OTGs online and I must say that this a perfect OTG for a small family for 2-3 people. The size is pretty small so do consider that. I managed to cook a medium size pizza. But quality and the heating is good. If you have a small family then you can definitely go for this one. Other than the size I loved the product😍
28,Deepashri Karandikar,16 September 2020,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just what I wanted,"Though slightly smaller than my expectations, this OTG has given me wonderful results so far. I have made cakes, paneer tikkas and pizzas so far, and all were really well done. The pizza base turned out so good, I dont think i will every buy ready-made bases henceforth."
29,Purnima,29 January 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,Happy purchase," I must say after much analysis of brands with Inalsa air frier I am happy with this purchase. It's really nice, easy to handle, can cook from a papad to soya chaap. Healthy way of cooking over Microwave and deep frying."

32,Anish Sharma,3 October 2019,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Too small,otherwise a good product",Purchased this item as a gift for my 10 years old daughter as she is interested in exploring her bakery skills however it's too small.

35,shyam prasad sv,31 October 2020,1.0 out of 5 stars,Defective item,"Received defective product. Not able to return as Amazon doesnot have the return policy. They have only replacement.

513,Somnath Sarkar,11 April 2021,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Initial review, Nice product at par with a premium range","Before I begin I would like to say that this order was made on my address by my friend from Mumbai who is a prime member, as I was not getting deliveries on time at my address from amazon.We received this product just a day before yesterday. I received the product in very good packing, but again late inspite of that being ordered from prime by my friend as mentioned earlier, which is getting very common nowadays with amazon in my area hence1star less, one good thing is that we got a call from inalsa yesterday for demo and installation (didn't expected that though)Before I begin with my initial review (final one we will do after some use) I would like to say that this is our FIRST OTG.Though prior to this we have been using only microwaves where we found that in a MW including a convection variant don't gives the desired results for any baked or grilled item, niether it has that space. Hence a MW is good for reheating and de-thawing in our case.Pros:1) I am already using an iron, and a mixer for 6 years, from brand inalsa, and moreover liked the looks of this product right away, its premium.2) Double tempered insulated glass door, an added advantage over any other premium brands, (they too don't have it) as it not only keeps the heat inside(saves your electricity bills) but it saves you from accidental heat burns also, from outside.3) It truly has a convection fan (few other brands like agaro a thousand rupees less in this range of 30L claims to have convection, but no fan as such. Might be having a smoke fan.. So dropped that option).4) looks big enough than the few other 30L variants that I have seen at my friends place, and can host a barbecue party with at least 7 to 8 friends.5) 1500 Watts an added advantage again.6) Special limited time deal price along with certain discount on a card made it really competitive.7) We believe in quality product (amazon basics products are also good, with competitive features, but still I cancelled their OTG variant for delay in the delivery) and hence though being a beginner we took this... Trust me at this price range what ever diction I have gone through in various write ups and forums prior to buying our FIRST OTG, this seems that it may be equally good for the professionals as well.These are the outstanding features which are added to this product at this price range and can even beat the premium ones, rest I'm not mentioning as they are common ones and are available with any other premium brands as well.Cons:a) No recipe booklet and hence finding it tough as a beginner.b) was expecting one more tray, a magic cloth, a gloves included.... Well again that's just my personal opinion, rest it's a good bargain. I'm happy with what I have got.c) Sick with amazon delivery for past 3 weeks which has happened for the first time in say last 8 years I'm associated with amazon. This has not been sorted out yet though I have given them multiple calls for the same.I might add a few more pros or cons once I start using the product regularly after the demo... But yes I would like to share I more thing... I find that in last few days the reviews has increased in leaps and bounds, I guess, it was say only 11 odd when I ordered it and now its in more than hundreds... Which itself proves that the sales have risen...and hence its not only me, many might have equally liked the product."
514,Xzar,9 February 2021,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Only one flaw, but very big one...","Got it after reading lot of reviews, Earlier got the IBELL 45 liter, but that was really strange, as the trays did not fit in the slots and the baking dish was dented and so returned that one.This one is great on paper, made cheese cake and cookies. Looks great, and sturdy. BUT , BUT BUT a warning to those who need only Lower rod. IT has upper and lower, but if you want a single rod then it has only upper, ok for broiling or tikkas, but may not work out for some types of cake. We have got it for essentially making cookies. and pizzas, so we are upset, but don't know if this will be a fatal flaw. This is the only oven i have seen that does not have lower only settings. If someone has an idea of how to do some jugaad and solve this problem, we are open to ideas. Thanks in aticipation."
