4,Sundarrajan P R,16 October 2020,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good but not the Best,"Not a best for Veg since optimum utilisation seems to be quite challenging.

126,SWAPAN KUMAR LAYEK,28 February 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,Nice
127,Amazon Buyer KS,14 December 2016,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Must For Foodies,"This is a wonderful product. I thought we had got value for money with the first dish that my wife made (Brinjals). The vegetable was cooked in the least quantity of oil possible and had retained the flavour. Normally, the flavour of the dish is lost significantly in deep frying and spices but the Brinjal cooked in the air fryer tasted better than ever before. The other dishes that came out top class were Chicken Tikka, Chicken Cutlets, Fish Amritsari, French Fries and Bread Rolls. Other dishes will be tried in due course. The instructions may say that no oil should be used. Please do not make the mistake of cooking anything without oil as it won't come out well. Whatever is to be cooked should be painted lightly with oil on all surfaces. Apply just enough oil to coat the surface and no more. This would amount to cooking with the least possible oil. Care should be taken that oil does not drip, otherwise it may catch fire inside.Some things that are traditionally deep fried should be eaten that way only as cooking in the air fryer will compromise the taste e.g. Khasta Kachori and Deep Fried Arvi. The Khasta Kachori was a bit dry. However, people with a health condition that requires a strict low fat diet can enjoy these two dishes made in the air fryer without deep frying and without any harm to their health. In fact, such people need not deprive themselves of their favourite food anymore as anything cooked in the air fryer will ensure that there is no harm to their health.The air fryer is also excellent for heating snacks like Cutlets, Puff, Samosa, Kachori, etc. It heats the snacks better than a microwave since in a microwave, the heating is not uniform and the core of the food item is much hotter than the surface which sometimes causes burns in the mouth. Heating in a microwave also causes the crust of the food item to be a bit chewy. The air fryer is good for toasting bread also.Papad and Popcorn should be avoided in the air fryer as it can fly inside and cause a fire.The air fryer is pretty light as it has a fibre body. It does not need much space either. Prestige is a household name and has priced its air fryer quite low. The only principle involved in an air fryer is cooking with hot air which this air fryer does wonderfully. Hence, there is no point in buying the more expensive brands with unnecessary frills. Go for it and enjoy healthy and tasty food."
128,Florence F.,31 July 2020,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very Disappointing,The unit does not seem brand new.Looks like it was opened by someone because it has following issues1. Packaging is not complete. No thermocol present2. Yellow spots (4 to 5 of them) present in front panel (around temperature controls)3.  No warranty card present4. Does not have nay documents or user/instruction manual5. Broken plastic part detected in packaging6. Oil brush missing

130,Amazon Customer,14 November 2016,1.0 out of 5 stars,very sad and rubbish,hi.... i have purchase this product in October 2016 and it is not working in November 2016. when contacted customer service for problem that said they would not provide the on site service and all i have to do is to carry the entire unit to their service center....... very sad and rubbish ... they have to provide me warranty replacement for this.....Amit Dhamapurkar.
131,Tathagata Chakraborty,3 October 2020,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Wastage of money, go for another brand!","Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


   The foods made with this air fryer smells plasticy. It's timer sounds like those old fashioned stop watches. You can't even change, reset or cancel the timer once it's set. Invest some more money and go for any other brand. Moreover, it's not made by Prestige. It's only imported and labelled by them. It's made in China. The experience it provides is really bad. Moreover, the product which I received, even had a slightly bent basket. Don't buy it."
132,lonewolf,17 May 2017,1.0 out of 5 stars,Maybe it's good But the worst part is the build of the ...,"Have cooked few dishes till now. So far not impressed. Maybe it's good  But the worst part is the build of the product. I might have got a defective piece but when it's on, the noise is unbearable. There is some rattling noise which is as loud as a mixer. It stops when I press the top of the fryer hard. Looks like something is loose. Have to call up service the within 3 days. So far, very unsatisfied."

155,N.Kaul,21 October 2019,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Like most people, received a broken and defective product.","I did not read the reviews before ordering this product, but my story is similar. The product was broken from the side and was not working - thank god I opened and checked it as I bought this for gifting purpose. As you can see in the pics, the packing was insufficient and they put this in a big box with some brown paper, which seems to be the cause of breakage. Returned product the same day and now thinking to order some other brand."
156,Dilip,16 October 2020,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Pathetic, zero satisfaction product! Twice returned for defective piece.","Extremely disappointing product. Twice returned since both the pieces refused to even switch on!! Even the replacement piece was like the first one - did not even switch on. A Prestige after sales authorised engineer checked and confirmed it was a defective piece. So it was not that the piece was mis- handled by the user.My worst experience with an Amazon purchase so far. Is it possible to give a ""zero star"" rating, please? And zero rating for customer satisfaction too."
157,PB,22 December 2019,1.0 out of 5 stars,One item I shouldn't have bought!,"Good money down the drain. I was looking to feast on healthy and tasty snacks cooked in this air fryer, but turns out that frying them in a kadhai is a much better, easier and quicker method. The French fries cooked in the air fryer looked thin and tasteless and took more than double the time as frying. Some old conventional methods are still better than technology! Sometimes, despite reading negative reviews, we tend to go ahead buy useless things and regret our decision later!Wouldn't recommend it but if you still have the itch, go ahead and learn the hard way!"
