0,Sumit Kumar,26 May 2020,5.0 out of 5 stars,Eat healthy and stay fit!!Worth every penny!!,"Well,my husband and I have been wanting to buy it from quite sometime after we have practically seen how awesome food it cooks and that too with much much less oil than normal cooking.I am totally in love with my new kitchen machine.I have cooked litti(Bihari delicacy) and it's awesome and super easy and convenient to make them in this machine.I have cooked besan wali bhindi,grilled chiken and pakodas,will be trying out samosas very soon.Got for it guys,it's worth every penny.Save  yourself with all the fried food without compromising too much on the taste."
1,Aastha,30 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth it,This product is really great...u just have to be realistic regarding your expectations from an air fryer...it makes tasty n delicious food but obviously healthy food is not going to taste as good as it’s fried version...but the difference in taste for frozen snacks is not much n I prefer air fried snacks n potato chips any day over fried ones.
2,Shekhar,14 August 2020,1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed with first Havells purchase!,The instruction manual was missing.The recipe book was missing.The serial number was already registered with Havells website - how is this possible if the product is new and not re-sold?
3,Amazon Customer,6 December 2019,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst service from Havells,"This rating is for Havells service. Sorry to say this but worst service from Havells. From 15 days I am calling customer care and still issue is not fixed, my call was disconnected by a customer care representative without answering the query. Air fryer is not powering on it's under warranty without addressing the issue case is closed. Worst service."
4,atul;,11 August 2020,4.0 out of 5 stars,No User Manual Or Recipe book along with delivery pkg,"Product was delivered in a carton box which had box containing Air Fryer.  Havells box was totally damaged. However, luckily, the air fryer was intact. Product is good.Main issue faced is that there was NO user manual or Recipe Book which shows as part of the package on Havells official website.We are first time user of the Air Fryer and were absolutely blank in how to use. We had to figure out thru trial and errors and exploring YouTube videos.Please send me the user manual & recipe book which is missing.  Otherwise the product is good."
5,Krishna parekh,30 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars,Supper,"Easy to use nd paisa vassol then other compare and economic,happy with that product"
6,Avinash Karnik,2 December 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good product if it is genuine.,Good product. Easy to use. Earlier I had ordered this from different seller but I had return it as it was not heating up. Only air was blowing. Then I placed new order on this seller & now I am satisfied with this piece. I found that bowl material thickness was more than earlier ordered product of same make. Even saperator plate was not fitting in bowl.May be it was duplicate product.
7,Neha gupta,7 November 2019,5.0 out of 5 stars,satisfactory,"This air fryer fulfills what it promises. its basket is large and one can cook, bake and grill in this fryer. requires no or minimum oil for few dishes but if u r making something from bread then i suggest you to apply oil/ghee in order to make it brown in color. the taste of the dishes of course differs in this as compare to the deep frying but not much. you can put a mould of 6' in its basket for baking cakes."
8,Gaurav Mantri,13 November 2020,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worthless product,Microwave can do whatever air frier can do. Besides mine started malfunctioning after 4 months. And service is pretty bad.

11,Varun Johar,9 September 2020,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best Item to have healthy, oil free stuff.","Using it almost every second day from past 1 year. I would say its one of the best thing that has come to our kitchen.No more oil fry requirements for readymade snacks of McCain etc. Paneer tikka, Chicken Tikka and other dishes are cooked with so much ease and saves lots of time and efforts.Please go for it without having 2nd thoughts coz its one time investment for your health."
12,Sanjay B,28 March 2019,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good product ar decent price,Good product at decent price. Happy with it.It has one of the largest roasting containers in the market.
13,Suhrid,1 December 2020,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good product. Button text indicators wore off in 2 days.,"Bought this for my parents. While the product itself is easy to use, quick and does what is supposed to, the quality of the paint job on the front panel is questionable. As you can see in the photo, the text wore off within two days of use. Now we just have to rely on memory as to which button is for what, or keep referring to the manual. That's a real shame. I've been reading a lot of reviews from other people about counterfeit products. I hope this one isn't from that batch."

18,Virendra,18 November 2020,1.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't give value for money combined with very very poor after sale service.,Company policy is sell and forget. Don't care performance of their product. Does not meet expectations and value of money you pay.Very poor after sale service. Emails to customer service are not attended and not even replied.

20,DEVESH AGARWAL,15 December 2020,4.0 out of 5 stars,Highly recommended and must have,"I was very doubtful about this technology of air fryer and how do you products be performing. But after reading a lot of reviews about different products I chose to buy Havel‘s considering his reputation in consumer electronics. I have been using this since last six months and frankly speaking I have not found even a single problem in it, even I have prepared snacks without any oil and they were just fantastic."

23,Deepesh,19 July 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars,Four Stars,Packing was damaged and product was fine. Beautiful product though.
24,Ranjita kulkarni,27 July 2020,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for a small family.,I use this product almost on a daily basis. As a family who loves fried food this method of cooking is a very acceptable substitute.The main drawback of this product is uneven cooking. You have to keep an eye on the food.I also wish they had accessories so that I can try different foods.
25,Amazon Customer,24 February 2020,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sturdy device and optimum performance,"Went through a lot of reviews and was confused between Philips and this product.While most were recommending Philips, I went with Havells air fryer. The product is very good, does what it says and there have been no issues since 2 months now."
26,jaydee,28 July 2020,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice bit of apparatus,Loving experimenting and new recipes from across the globe. Do wish it could have catered for about 300* C instead of just 200; does limit the scope just a tad.
27,Ripal Kadakia,11 November 2019,5.0 out of 5 stars,A must use product for Healthy eating,"Easy to use and clean. Uses hardly few drops of oil to fry things. Would recommend it to people who prefer having healthy food. Cooks fast and oil free, yet tastes like it it’s fried. Does deep fry also very effectively."

29,Amazon Customer,7 November 2020,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good. Using for 6+ MOnths.,"Using for 6 months now. It is good. Good to prepare finger chips, Paneer Tickka, Fish/Chicken kabab etc...without much oil (without deep fry). One drawback is the frying bowl is very thin and handle is not that strong."
30,Parag Khimani,29 July 2019,2.0 out of 5 stars,Average Product,"Not of much use in everyday life. Can only handle small quantity for 2 people. If you have more people for dinner or lunch, then you have find another alternate."
31,Tanya sarah,6 November 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars,value for money BUT remote does not work,"product is amazing , value for money and delivers what it promises / advertises. However a disappointment that the remote does not work and thus the heating options cannot be used as it is as option given on the remote only and not on the product. Don't think the remote itself will be replaced by the seller and this is a big let down to an otherwise good product."
32,sameer sheikh,2 November 2019,1.0 out of 5 stars,Received damaged item twice. Finally gave up on this order.,"The first time I ordered, the separator was missing and the tray was slightly chipped. The product I received after exchange was again damaged as shown in the image."

35,Amazon Customer,14 October 2018,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Oil will decrease, but cooking time will increase.","Only purpose for buying it was to reduce the amount of oil which we intake while eating deep fried edibles like fish fry, pakodas etc. For this the device serves it's purpose. But on the other hand cooking takes lot of time and the amount of food one can cook at a time is also very less, adding up to the cooking time."
36,shagupta akram naikwadi,18 August 2020,1.0 out of 5 stars,damaged product received,box was damaged and the airfryer was also broken.
37,Triveni Prasad Nanda,18 October 2019,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nifty product for guilt-free eating.,"It's a nice product, a bit bulky for my space though.Cooks fairly well.

42,Indresh Bhatia,11 July 2020,4.0 out of 5 stars,Amongst the Best,"Have used it for almost a month. Works fine. Easy to use. Only drawback is that at times the touch function is bit sluggish. Material is fine Only if handled carefully, could have been more sturdy, specially for the price band it comes in. Seems most of the companies have this policy to downgrade material specs while providing other features."
43,Shamit S,19 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is an amazing product !,"This is an excellent product that I added in our kitchen to have oil free roasted foods everyday.

Very easy to cook in it and much easier to clean. Can cook cookies too,  as good as a convection oven (if not better), as both work on similar principle (air dryer hot air supply is much stronger than that of a convection oven, so be careful with the baking period)."
47,krishnaajith,13 May 2020,3.0 out of 5 stars,Okay !!,Everything is good . But the product looks like it's used before .

255,Boudhayan Bhattacharyya,5 October 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic Product !,"Thoroughly loved it. You can have marinated fish/chicken grilled WITHOUT PUTTING ANY OIL AT ALL.French fries are good enough. People on strict diet will absolutely love this.  Totally justifies the price. Although I got it at a 60% discount, but considering its benefits, I wouldn't mind half to pay the full price.One catch: eat the food as quickly as possible once it is done; if you keep it for long, it loses its crisp and turns stale and leathery."
256,aniket,18 August 2017,4.0 out of 5 stars,awesome for making helathy french fries,quite an easy to use kitchen appliance..worth the money in the long-run especially because oil intake reduces drastically..very safe to use...digital indicator and touch panel is also very good so far..just made french fries and they smelled and tasted so awesome..i love McDonald's fries..but this one surely competes well and is lot healthier than theirs since oil is almost negligible
257,Vaishnavi ,11 August 2017,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Looks brilliant, works well so far","Just got it today. Looks brilliant, works well so far. From the other air fryers I have seen, this one has a considerably larger capacity. Worth the investment."
258,Trish,13 June 2017,5.0 out of 5 stars,"looks really nice, very easy to use","looks really nice, very easy to use...finally used it for the first time...fried some frozen veggie nuggets for 10 mins and it came out crisp...so easy and convenient and oil free...hope it continues to give us excellent service..."
259,Madhurav Sah ,27 September 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works well,I have used this product for 2 weeks so far not a single complaint. One of the best air frier I have seen so far at this price range.
260,Amazon Customer,29 April 2017,5.0 out of 5 stars,Go for it,Good product. Working fine after use for 3 months approx. No complaints. Packing of the product was good.
261,Nusrat Begum,8 August 2020,5.0 out of 5 stars,Airfryer only if you dont have otg or oven at home,Its a perfect appliance for a small family. We have to be careful with the term aid fryer. It can be used alternately as otg / oven. If you have an otg or oven dont got for an air fryer.If you going for one then i tell you this is a very healthy applicance. The taste offcourse differs but if you consideriing health then this gets a 5 star rating.You can bake cakes and bread too in it.
262,Harish Dua,25 July 2017,1.0 out of 5 stars,The seller dispatched the only defective piece he had with him.,"The product was defective, it did not start, it did not have any warranty card and no recepie book. The product it seems, the only piece of seller was dispatched without check. I did not receive any responce from seller on making complaint, so I had no other altrnative but to return the same."
263,Rajesh Katoch,28 December 2016,4.0 out of 5 stars,Four Stars,"Good item, worth for amount invested."
264,Kriti Bhatia,5 November 2018,2.0 out of 5 stars,Fan stopped working - Do not buy,"On the second day of use, the most important component ""fan"" stooped working.Quality seems very average.Handle lock looks very loose.Bad product.Repeated follow ups with company - no solution. For last one month product is with the company and they are neither able to repair nor refund money nor replace. Never buy any Havells product. Worst products and after sale service is big ZERO."
265,Ankush Singh,23 February 2019,3.0 out of 5 stars,Okay not that great,Delivery was late. Looks good in kitchen. Value for money if you use frequently otherwise its just a BIG TOY in the kitchen
266,VIJAYA KUMAR J,15 November 2019,5.0 out of 5 stars,Broken display,The product is very very good👍👍But there was a problem in the deliveryThe front panel was broken and display didn't work.But then also Amazon's refund service was fast and awesome.I got the money back in just one day.😁👍
267,Om,22 August 2017,2.0 out of 5 stars,Overrated,"Massively overrated product. Good for making french fries and very few other things. Recipe book from Havell's only includes some 5-7 vegetarian recipes.For a normal indian household which cooks a variety of items, you'll be left wondering what temperatures to set to make a particular item since there's no guidance available anywhere.Youtube videos which claim to have made great are a complete and total farce.It is touted as the replacement to frying but it isn't anywhere close to that. Most food items will require at least an oil coating on them to be made properly. And the others, you simply can't make with an air fryer.Overall its a dud technology for India with limited usability but high marketing & propaganda by the makers."
268,Amazon Customer,19 November 2019,4.0 out of 5 stars,Oxyfryer for vegans.,"Useful for vegans. Left over Biscuits, matthhris, peanuts, golgappas, can be oxyfried and they become fresh and crisp. Basically, I would like to call it a crisper."
269,Amazon Customer,28 March 2021,4.0 out of 5 stars,It is good,Easy to use. However facing problem to remove fixed tray for cleaning. Working with out any problem. Overall it is good
270,Bharat,20 July 2017,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fully digital Air fryer with very smooth buttons │ Actual capacity only 2.5 L, NOT 4 L as advertised","I bought this Havells Prolife Digi Air fryer from Amazon in July 2017 for Rs.9982/- after much contemplation whether to go for Philips 5220 or this.Unfortunately, the key requirement I chose this Havells air fryer instead of Philips is not fulfilled which I recognized only after getting the product: The requirement is that my wife wanted larger capacity. The Philips HD 9220 is 2.2 L of capacity which we found is small. We even went to a local retail to check the size. As Havells is advertising the capacity as 4 L, we went for this one which is almost the same cost.The main misleading point is that Havells says ""Pan capacity of 4L"", but we can't cook anything directly in the pan. The basket that goes into it in which we put the actual food ingredients is only 2.5 L. Hence, the actual effective capacity is only 2.5 L. Anyway, I couldn't see any other air fryer which offers capacity greater than this 2-3L range, hence retained the product._____PROs:¯¯¯¯¯👍 Full digital - no manual rotatable knobs. Display of temperature and time makes it easy to configure instead of knobs.👍 The touch of buttons is very smooth. Just graze the finger over it and it takes the input, no need to press.👍 Functioning is excellent - made french fries as per the recipe mentioned in the recipes book obtained along with the product and they turned out perfect.👍 Product looks sturdy - plastic quality is very good.👍 Havells is a very well known brand. So, can go for it as an alternative to Philips_____CONs:¯¯¯¯¯👎 The capacity of the basket is only 2.5 L. Havells is misleadingly advertising ""pan capacity = 4 L"" which can't be used for actual cooking. It's just for collecting excess oil during cooking.👎 The operation manual is almost useless. They just changed the name and gave the Havell's old model's (one with the knobs) manual. So, you need to figure out the buttons usage yourself through experimentation.👎 The name of the buttons is misleading. ""Mode"" is for temperature setting, ""Timer+ and Timer-"" are for timer settings. There is no concept of modes. I couldn't see any operation of ""Call"" button which even doesn't glow."
271,Purchaser,25 March 2019,1.0 out of 5 stars,Disgusting product from havells,"Unexpected and disappointed that this is a Havells product, which has become a good brand recently!The first piece started giving out a white smoke and burning platic smell as soon as it was On (no oil or food stuff was burning, its circuit was giving white smoke).The replacement arranged by Amazon  also turned out to be faulty and didnt on even when plugged in.Amazon service is excellent in handling the replacement and refund. Havells should do better job with this product to make it like Philips products in terms of quality."
272,Gopal Singh,7 February 2020,1.0 out of 5 stars,Brand name is suffering reliability problem now.,We use the air fryer in a limited way.  It was put to use no more than 10 times since its purchase.  It quit.  There were problems with the power circuit.  I know for sure there were no chances for overloading it.  It cost me Rs. 1800 to get it fixed.  I have had other brand air-fryers for 5 years+ with no problems. I also have a 3 hp single phase submersible pump Havells starter that has been continuously giving me problems.  Their products command a premium in pricing and repairs are expensive.Seems to me Havells is losing it. They are cashing in on their brand name.  Remains to be seen how long it lasts.
273,Dr Reddy,19 September 2020,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good one,"Hi you get 70 to 75% % of taste and flavour like deep fry. But very easy to fry. It takes 6+6 minutes for chicken 10 leg pieces. Fish 10 mins, prawns 8 mins , remember coat light oil on the pieces and change the side while frying. Gives good fry.Very quick n easy ... we can’t put more 1/2 kg I guess. Because the bowl will accommodate that much. Little frying smell u get. But negligible compared to the work with deep oil fry."
274,Nazrana ,27 January 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice product. Love it,"I am in love with this product. Its amazing, i make fries, chicken, nuggets, cake. And i have been using this for two months now. Only thing dont fall in trap of Zero EMI option, they charge you, and you are left between calling bank and amazon. Better pay one time and pay less."
275,Dr. NIRMALYA HORE,7 February 2019,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exactly as advertised.,Pros: Good buildHigh wattage so quick cookingLess noiseNon stick coating is goodOilless cooking possibleAt 7000 INR a 4ltr air fryer from a good brand is a stealCons: Setting of time takes some timeWould be better if there were knobsThe separator felt flimsy
276,George Thomas,11 December 2019,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Must in every kitchen,The product met and actually surpassed expectations. It makes ease of most tasks and its design is actually a little more cleaning friendly than the model I was using earlier which was more of a mesh making cleaning quite painful. Cooks well and most importantly quite fast as well.
